# healthy-food
 choose the best diet for you

This project uses a lot of functionality written in vanilla js. The modal window is called up in three ways: by clicking on certain buttons, when the user has flipped through the page to the end, if within 30 seconds a person has not opened the modal, it will also open. A feedback form appears in a modal window through which the user sends his data without reloading the page to the json server. If the sending was successful, then another modal window appears with information that the sending has occurred, otherwise the user will see that something went wrong. The page also has tabs and a slider that moves the image left and right. The calculator for calculating calorie needs per day uses real formulas for different people. He is able to remember some information from the user using local storage. To check the data that is entered, I use regular expressions. Cards from the menu for the day are built dynamically using the constructor and take data from the db.json server. At the end of the page is a countdown timer that notifies the user when the promotion ends.
